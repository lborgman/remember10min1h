                    <h2>The dark side - Technology</h2>
                    <p>This app is actually just a web site with two additions
                        (made possible by that it is a PWA):
                    <div style="margin-top: 10px;">1) You can view it even if you are not online.</div>
                    <div>2) You can 'share' to it.</div>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Good security</h3>
                    <p>Because this app is just a web site it is just as secure as a web site.
                        It can't harm your mobile or computer (more than a web site can).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Share currently works only on Android</h3>
                    <p>Unfortunately Â´shareÂ´ to this app can only work on Android with Google Chrome today.
                        It is the only case where the technical capabilities are available now.
                        But you can still use this app now on for example both on iPhone and Windows.
                        It is just the possibility to 'share' that does not work there.

                <b>Fc4i</b> is yet another app for saving links to

                , from the web page).

                There are some very good apps for that (like
                <a href="https://9to5google.com/2023/01/31/what-you-can-do-google-keep/">Google

            <p>
                <b>Tools for learning:</b>
                My reason for writing
                Fc4i was to add integrated tools for learning, like flashcards, repeating reminders, etc.
                I also included some tools to stimulate thinking:
                <a href="#mm4i">mindmaps</a>, <a href="#nwg">network view</a>.

                    They are more like <i>"can you please tell me now if there is something I ought to repeat now?"</i>

                            <summary>Native app vs web app</summary>
                            The fc4i app and its companions are a
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app">progressive web apps (PWA)</a>.
                            Google Keep is a native app.
                            <p>
                                While I install a native app from Google without hesitating
                                I rather avoid installing a native app from
                                some unknown developer (like me).
                                The reason is security concerns.
                                A PWA is essentially just a web page.
                                So it is normally not more dangerous to use than a web page.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another advantage of web apps is that they should work
                                everywhere where there is an uptodate web browser.
                                (But sadly, sharing to a web app is yet not standardised enough.
                                It probably only works on Android mobiles and tablets.)

            </div>
            <p>
                When I first heard about mindmaps I thought it looked like
                a very good idea.
                But I never tried to use it.
                Until one day I talked with a woman studying the same subject as I at the university.
                She said that she could read a book in one hour and remember it
                with the help of mindmaps.
            </p>
            <p>
                I still did not try mindmaps since I never had enough big papers and colored
                pencils with me.
                But I was determined to try.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then one day I saw that there was a Javascript library for
                creating mindmaps,
                <a href="https://github.com/hizzgdev/jsmind">jsMind</a>.
                Fantastic! It can be used in any modern web browser.
                I decided to make something that you could use on a mobile phone
                built on that Javascript library.
                That became mm4i.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mm4i is integrated with fc4i.
                You can easily link to subjects in fc4i in a mindmap you create with mm4i.
                However, mm4i can be used alone. No need to use fc4i.
                (You can link to web pages in nodes in mindmaps if you want to.)
